# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key technical decisions for HybridRAG.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue being decided?
- **Decision**: What is the change or decision?
- **Consequences**: What are the results (positive and negative)?
