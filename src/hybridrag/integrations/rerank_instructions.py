"""
Intelligent instruction generation for instruction-following reranking.

Follows Voyage AI's official patterns from MongoDB blog post:
https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/instruction-following-reranking/

Instructions use hierarchical prioritization patterns:
- "Prioritize X, followed by Y, then Z, and finally W"
- "Prioritize X and Y" (for multiple criteria)
- Keep instructions concise and action-oriented
