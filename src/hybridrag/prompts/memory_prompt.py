Memory and Session Prompt Templates.

Prompts for conversation memory management:
- Progressive summarization of conversation history
- Session context generation for returning users
- Memory compression for long conversations

These prompts enable efficient context management for multi-turn
conversations while preserving important information.

Usage:
    from hybridrag.prompts import (
        MEMORY_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT,
        SESSION_CONTEXT_PROMPT,
    )

    # Summarize conversation history
    prompt = MEMORY_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT.format(
        existing_summary=previous_summary,
        new_messages=recent_messages,
        max_tokens=500
    )
